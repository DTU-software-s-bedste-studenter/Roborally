  This is an example of a very simple JavaFX application following
  the MVC-pattern (slightly more strictly as usual). It was made
  for the course
  "<a href="http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/courses/02362/">Project in Software Engineering (02362)</a>"
  held at <a href="https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english">DTU Compute</a> by
  <a href="http://people.compute.dtu.dk/ekki/">Ekkart Kindler</a>.<p></p>

  The purpose is to show and discuss different aspects of the MVC-pattern and
  JavaFX applications. Some of the assignments of the course will be based
  on this project. In addition, the project is structured in such a way, that
  project of the course can be based on this project.<p></p>
